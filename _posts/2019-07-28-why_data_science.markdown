For a few years now, Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Engineering and so on have consistently topped career and growth industry charts. It's a field that is growing incredibly with a noted shortfall of professionals prepared to fill the needs of companies and government organizations seeking well trained and experienced talent. With that in mind, you could easily ask, 'why not Data Science?'. 

But, like a lot of things, it's not that simple. Currently, I work at a large firm, managing programs dedicated to career development for military veterans. As an Army veteran myself it's a great opportunity to give back to a community that means a lot to me and has supported me well. I regularly get the opportunity to talk to people that are transitioning from a very unique career in the military to a much different one in the private sector. The people that have a clear and well-informed idea of what they want to do next are rare. After all, it's hard to pick a career. So many things about work and work-life are difficult to gauge without trying them out, but of course, trying out careers is not like picking out a new pair of jeans. We invest so much more of ourselves into what we do every day for work, and it's not that easy to change course quickly or frequently. 

I bring this up because one of the first questions I ask people when we are talking about new careers is, 'What do you _want_ to do?'. Do you want to make a lot of money? Is work-life balance important? Do you want to be outside? Do you want to talk to customers? Do you want to work with numbers?... What do you _like_ to do? 

Whether or not a job is in a growing field, or the highest paid, or at the best company, it won't matter if you hate the work. Money, prestige, and acclaim are all great things (don't get me wrong, I want them), but they're a poor tradeoff for spending 40-50hrs a week (or more) doing something that really drags you down. It's important to find work that engages you and that at times you even enjoy. 

For me, that's the answer to 'Why data science?'. I think this stuff is cool! For the past 4-5 years, I've noticed that the days I 'lose myself' in my work are the ones where I have a pile of spreadsheets that I can play with. Not noticing hours go by as I slice populations and create new variables to track the progress of the programs I manage. Developing and answering questions about how different segments of talent perform in different circumstances, and then visualizing it to share with others and brief executives. Its work I think is fun but also happens to provide business value and important insights for our programs and overall strategy. 

But, as cool as that is, relative to what's going on in the great world of Data Science, right now I'm working with limited tools in a smaller environment. Thousands of rows of data with dozens of columns. That might sound like a lot if you're not as familiar with working with data, but to put into context, a large consumer data set may have millions of rows and thousands of columns, and they get much bigger.

Imagine the insights that can be drawn from that volume of information, and we're producing more of it every moment, from as many sources as you can imagine. I believe that learning the methods and tools to work with that data will help me expand my skills in an area I already know that I enjoy. To me, this is like moving from tee-ball to baseball (maybe softball now that my shoulders aren't what they once were). I know the fundamentals of the game, but there is so much more to learn and hours to spend practicing to get my game to the next level, where I can play with the people that are already practicing Data Science full-time. It's going to be a great challenge, and I really look forward to seeing where it takes me.
