<p>I'm a data science student at the Flatiron School. After years of admiring the insights generated by people that get to work in analytics and data science, I decided that I want to join them. It's going to be a challenging and rewarding journey to develop my skills in this area while balancing work and life, but nothing worth doing is easy! Thanks for following my work, if you're learning too please let me know if I can help (or more likely, you can help me).  - Ryan </p>
